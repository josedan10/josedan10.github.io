          Hello, my name is Jos√© Daniel. I'm a student, guitar player, singer, developer, athlete and video games lover.
          <br />
          <br />
          Everything I do, I do it because I love doing it. Much of my time is spent experimenting and learning new trends to always offer the best to those who need my services.
          <br />
          <br />
          I do not consider myself a designer, because the art of design is something that requires a lot of time and dedication to understand it, but I do my best to offer visually pleasing solutions to my clients using some of the knowledge I have acquired by doing a little research on my own.
          <br />
          <br />
          Whenever I can I try to learn something new, that can help me to continue growing as an integral professional, capable of providing solutions to a wide range of needs.
